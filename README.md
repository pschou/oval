# OVAL Tracker

A batch of OVAL files archived by distro for tracking over time.

This internet archive is made available for security research and validation.  The files within are normalized for long-term tracking purposes.   This normalization involves changing the original ID naming and ordering values so additions or subtractions appear as line additions and subtractions.  This kind of line-to-line comparison avoids using additional tools to do deep inspections.  Any use or reference to this normalized content should respect the ownership and licensing of the original data owners.  This content is in an AS-IS state and intended for personal use, meaning users assume all responsibility and liabilities.
